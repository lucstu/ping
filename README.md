# Ping üõ∞Ô∏è
Ping is a Python program made to notify a user when an item is listed or restocks at various online retailers.

### Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes ONLY. It should not be used in practice and is only used to show a practical application of web scraping in Python for learning.

### Why?
Scraping can be viewed as something as very abstract given the amount of things you can do with it. One problem I often run into is items running out of stock before I even notice they are listed (very often with the supply shortages caused by COVID-19). This is a practical solution that could fix a problem I experienced.
